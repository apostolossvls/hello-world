# hello-world
first things first

Happy to be a part of this community but, the sad thing is that i am only going to use github just to share scripts as a file hosting service, at least for some time. Maybe i'm going to upload c# scripts i've made so far. Started learning the roots of c# with c and c++. Also I've made mini python programs and i can read matlab code now. Some of the code I've made is "handmade" and could have been more efficient and easy to make if I have looked more things up from kind programmers that wish to help! I chose to make mistakes and be proud of them. I hope to releash a game I've been working for a while.I think I pasted the "i dont know how to continue..." part, so I am doing great. Thats it for now.
