first things first

Happy to me a part of this community but, the sad thing is that i am only going to use github just to share scripts as a file hosting service, at least for some time. Maybe i'm going to upload so c# scripts i've made so far. Some of them are "handmade" and could have been more efficient and easy to make if i have looked more things up from kind programmers that wish to help! I chose to make mistakes and be proud of them. I hope to releash a game I've been working for a while.I think I pasted the "i dont know how to continue..." part, so I am doing great. Thats it for now. -3/1
